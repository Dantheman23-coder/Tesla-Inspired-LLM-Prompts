# TeslaMind

TeslaMind is a lightweight toolkit and prompt collection inspired by Nikola Tesla's approach to innovation.
Use it to explore personas, modes, and reusable prompt templates for your own LLM projects.

## Quick start

```bash
teslamind list                        # view available prompts
teslamind personas list               # discover narrative perspectives
teslamind modes apply energy "Calibrate inductive coils"  # preview stylistic guardrails
teslamind compose "Design a lunar grid" --persona visionary-inventor --mode visionary
```

For power users, TeslaMind also exposes [advanced features](advanced.md) such as
self-looping refinement, federated evaluation, RLHF stubs, and a clinical safety
filter.
