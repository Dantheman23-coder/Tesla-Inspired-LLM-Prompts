# TeslaMind

TeslaMind is a lightweight toolkit and prompt collection inspired by Nikola Tesla's approach to innovation.
Use it to explore personas, modes, and reusable prompt templates for your own LLM projects.

For power users, TeslaMind also exposes [advanced features](advanced.md) such as
self-looping refinement, federated evaluation, RLHF stubs, and a clinical safety
filter.
