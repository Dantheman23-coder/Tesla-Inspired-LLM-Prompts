# Advanced Features

> **Note**
> The canonical advanced feature guide now lives at [`docs/advanced.md`](docs/advanced.md)
> so it can be published with the documentation site. This top-level copy is kept
> for compatibility with older links and summarizes the same guidance.

For the complete walkthrough, examples, and API references, please open
[`docs/advanced.md`](docs/advanced.md). The material below mirrors the package
APIs so existing references stay up to date.

```
Self-looping refinement  → `teslamind.advanced.SelfLoopingPromptRefiner`
Federated evaluation     → `teslamind.advanced.FederatedEvaluator`
RLHF trainer             → `teslamind.advanced.RLHFTrainer`
Clinical safety filter   → `teslamind.advanced.ClinicalSafetyFilter`
```

The rest of the document is intentionally left minimal to avoid duplicating the
full guide. Keeping this file in place allows legacy readers and mirrors to
redirect to the maintained documentation without encountering missing links.
